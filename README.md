## About the project

Simple personal project replicating the functionalities of the pomodoro.io website, done for the following academic reasons: 
- To combine the HTML BEM structure alongside the SCSS pre-processor, with the intent of making the code as clean as possible. This involves studying its resources, such as nesting, CSS modularization, and the 7-1 architecture.
- To practice ternary operations in pure JavaScript (since I've been using a lot of jQuery lately).
- To familiarize myself with the native web notifications API of JavaScript.
- To learn how to implement a sound effect triggered by a specific action
